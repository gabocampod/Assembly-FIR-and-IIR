# Assembly-FIR-and-IIR
This project presents four algorithms for real-time audio processing using assembly based on finite impulse response (FIR) and infinite impulse response (IIR) filters.

The results show that real time operation can be achieved up to sampling frequencies of 80kHz, meaning this code can be used to enhance audio quality at the professional recording standard (48kHz)

Software requirements: Atmel studio 7.

Hardware requirements: Atmega 328p microcontroller and a 10 bit-ADC.
